# Community Repositories

The [prometheus-community organization](https://github.com/prometheus-community) collects projects associated with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) that are not part of the [prometheus organization](https://github.com/prometheus) itself.

Support for community projects is best-effort on the part of the Prometheus project.
Each project must have a sponsor from the [Prometheus team](https://prometheus.io/governance/#team-members).
